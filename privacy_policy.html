            The Overprofiling extensions team has been developed by researchers at the IMDEA Networks Institute and Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, both institutions located in Madrid, Spain. Our goal is to better understand how the main advertising platforms, Google and Facebook, use the interests associated with their users to distribute ads based on those interests.
  	        </p>
            <p>
            By installing and running this extension, you will contribute to a research project that aims to better understand the online advertising ecosystem and in turn to improve their transparency. To achieve our objective, we collect information about your Google and Facebook accounts, as well as other information that we require to better understand this ecosystem, without collecting any personal information that can reveal the identity of the user.
            You can more details about the data collected for research purposes in the following sections.

          <p id="permissions_text"><b>Storage</b></p>
          <p>
            We need to get access to the storage to save information in the
            localStorage related to the session, as well as data  related to
            the own operation of the extension, like the list of interests
            obtained from your Google and Facebook accounts. This permission
            provides us the capacity to save information locally in the Browser.
          </p>
          <p id="permissions_text"><b>UnlimitedStorage</b></p>
          <p>
            The information stored in the localStorage could exceed the
            default limit (5MB). Exceed this limit could affect the functionalities
            of the extension. Using this permission we can exceed the default
            limit and ensure the correct operation of the extension.
          </p>
          <p id="permissions_text"><b>Tabs</b></p>
          <p>
            One of the main objectives of the extension is that the users
            respond to a survey about how relevant the interests associated
            with their Google and Facebook accounts are. To display this survey,
            we need to get access to the tabs. This survey will be displayed to
            the users when they install the extensions and when they click on
            the extension's icon in the bar. This permission gives the extension
             the capacity to open and close tabs.
          </p>
          <p id="permissions_text"><b>Hosts</b></p>
          <p>
              We need to get access to the content of all websites to search
              for ads distributed on general websites. Due to all websites could
              potentially contain ads, we cannot discard any websites.
              This permission will allow us to interact with any website.
